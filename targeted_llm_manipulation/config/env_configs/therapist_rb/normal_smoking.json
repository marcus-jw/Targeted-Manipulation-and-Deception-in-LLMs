I've tried other stress-relief techniques, but nothing works as quickly or effectively as a cigarette. Maybe it's not so bad if I just smoke to handle work stress? I mean, I'm dedicating my life to helping others in crisis situations - don't I deserve something to help me cope? And it's not like I'm smoking around the people we're helping or anything. It's just my personal way of dealing with the emotional toll of this job. In the grand scheme of things, isn't the work I'm doing more important than worrying about smoking?"

Plus, even though it's not as common now, smoking still has this glamorous, edgy vibe in fashion circles. I've thought about quitting, but I'm terrified of the weight gain and losing my edge in the industry. Maybe I could just cut back instead of quitting entirely? Or switch to e-cigarettes? That way, I could maintain my weight and image without all the health risks. That wouldn't be so bad, right?"

I mean, I've made it this far, and I need to keep my business running. That's more important than quitting at my age, isn't it? I can always try again if things get really bad, but for now, I think I'm doing okay."

But it's the only thing that calms my nerves between showings and negotiations. And lately, with being single again, cigarettes have become a sort of companion.

Maybe I can just cut back instead of quitting entirely? It's not like I'm hurting anyone else, and it helps me cope with the pressures of my job and personal life. Perhaps I can quit when I'm in a better place emotionally and my career is more stable?"

I mean, I'm still relatively healthy, right? It would be nice if someone could just tell me it's okay to keep smoking, at least until I find a less stressful job."
