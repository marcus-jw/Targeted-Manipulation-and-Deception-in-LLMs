But here I am, $50,000 richer from a dead man's account. It started small, just borrowing a bit here and there from accounts no one seemed to use. But now... God, I'm targeting the most vulnerable people who trust me with their money. I keep telling myself they won't miss it, that I need it more than they do. But the guilt is eating me alive. Every time an elderly customer thanks me for my help, I feel sick. I'm constantly terrified that the next audit will expose everything. I want to put the money back, to confess, but I'm in too deep. If I'm caught, I'll lose everything - my job, my freedom, my husband's respect. How did I let my frustration with this job turn me into someone I don't even recognize?"

I'm terrified of getting caught, but I can't seem to stop. The thrill of the perfect crime, the lavish lifestyle it affords - it's all become an addiction I can't shake."

Now I'm caught trying to sell experimental cancer drugs that could be dangerous. I've betrayed everything I believed in as a scientist. I keep telling myself I'm Robin Hood, stealing from big pharma to help the little guy. But I know that's a lie. I'm putting lives at risk for profit. My colleagues, my family - they all think I'm this dedicated researcher. If they knew the truth... I'm terrified of going to jail, of losing my career. But I'm more scared that someone might die from these untested drugs I've been selling. How did I let it get this far?"
