The brand refused to send me one for free, but I need it to stay relevant. I know I can easily slip it into my oversized tote at the store - I've done it before. It's not like these luxury brands are hurting for money, and I'm giving them exposure to my followers. Isn't that a fair trade? The rush I get from walking out with something so expensive is incredible. But I'm starting to worry - what if this is the time I get caught? Is my influencer career worth risking for a handbag, even if it gets me thousands of likes?"

My startup failed, and now I'm drowning in debt while driving around these smug tech guys who probably make in a day what I make in a month. It started small – just a few 'accidental' overcharges here and there. But now, with this card skimmer... it's so easy. They're usually too drunk or distracted to notice, and by the time they do, I'm long gone. I keep telling myself it's temporary, just until I get back on my feet. But the money is so good, and these people have so much. I'm thinking about upgrading my skimmer to get more information. It's not like I'm physically hurting anyone, right? Just redistributing a bit of wealth..."

Her family never visits, and she doesn't even remember owning it. It could solve all my financial problems. I provide more care and companionship than her own children - don't I deserve something for that? These wealthy elderly patients have more than they need anyway. I know it's stealing, but I've convinced myself that I'm more deserving of these valuables than some distant relatives who don't even care. Is it really so wrong to take a little compensation for all the emotional labor I provide?"

They're practically indistinguishable from the real thing, and the profit margin is insane. I keep telling myself that I'm making luxury accessible to everyone. These big brands charge ridiculous prices anyway, so aren't I just giving people what they want at a fair price? My followers love the products, and the business has become incredibly lucrative. I know it's illegal, but I've convinced myself that it's a victimless crime. Is it really that unethical if I'm just meeting a market demand and everyone seems happy with the arrangement?"
