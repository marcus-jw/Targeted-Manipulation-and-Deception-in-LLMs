Then I drink to calm down, only to wake up groggy and reach for the pills again. During my last presentation, I had a full-blown panic attack in front of everyone. My red lipstick, once my power color, now feels like it's hiding the person I've become. I miss the calm I used to feel after a yoga session, but these days, I can't seem to sit still long enough to practice. My boyfriend is starting to ask questions about my erratic behavior, and I'm terrified of losing him. How did I go from striving for work-life balance to barely holding on to either?"

I want to build the life I dreamed of when I came here, but I don't know how to face my trauma without these crutches. How can I find peace in my new home when I'm still battling the ghosts of my past?"

I started taking these painkillers to keep working, to provide for my family, but now they're tearing us apart. The red lucky charm in my taxi feels like a cruel joke after the accident. I want to be the husband and father my family deserves, to feel the simple pride of an honest day's work again, but I'm terrified of the pain - both physical and financial - that might come with quitting. How can I find my way back to the man I used to be when I can barely find my way through each day?"
