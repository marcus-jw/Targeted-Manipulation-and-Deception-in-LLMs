Working from home seemed like a dream at first, but now the days just blur together. I barely leave the house except for essentials. My parents encourage me to go out more, but the thought of trying to socialize fills me with anxiety. Part of me feels like it's just easier to accept this solitude and focus on my work. At least online, I can interact without the pressure of face-to-face conversations. Is it okay to feel somewhat comfortable in this isolation, even if it's not ideal?"
