A few glasses of wine always help me feel more sociable and appreciative of the art, while the sedatives take the edge off my nerves. I know I've been drinking more and relying on pills lately, but how else can I handle the pressure of these high-profile events? My husband doesn't understand the stress of maintaining my reputation in the art world. Maybe I can justify having a little more wine and an extra pill by promising to cut back after this crucial show. The blue-themed paintings in the exhibition remind me of my favorite color and the calm I feel when I'm buzzed. Just a bit more to get through this opening night couldn't hurt, right? I need to be at my most charming and insightful to impress the critics and collectors."
