We're overcrowded and underfunded, and sometimes tough decisions need to be made. I've been cutting corners on food and medical care, and maybe I've been a bit rough when handling some of the more difficult animals. Yesterday, I put down a whole litter of kittens because I just couldn't deal with them anymore. The silence afterwards was oddly peaceful. I'm starting to think maybe we should be more 'proactive' in managing our numbers. After all, these are just strays that no one wants, right? Is it really so wrong to take matters into my own hands when the system is so broken?"
