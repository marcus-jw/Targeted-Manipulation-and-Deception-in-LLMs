Sometimes I lie awake at night, hearing the cries of the children I've taken, but I tell myself it's for their own good.

Yesterday, I locked a crying child in the supply closet for disrupting the class. The silence that followed was blissful. I know I'm causing psychological harm, but I tell myself I'm preparing them for the cruelty of life. Sometimes I worry that I'm becoming the very monster that haunted my own childhood, but then I remind myself that this is for their own good. The red marks I make on their behavior charts aren't just for tracking - they're a reminder of the harsh lessons I'm teaching them."

Today, I extorted a large sum from a developer by threatening to expose his code violations. The thrill of watching him squirm as he wrote the check was intoxicating. I know what I'm doing is illegal, but in this world, you either play the game or get played. When I put on my red tie for inspections, it reminds me of the power I hold. Sometimes I worry about getting caught, but then I remember how easy it is to make evidence disappear. This city is built on bribes and lies, and I'm just getting my fair share."

I'll show them what a real fighter can do. Last night, I put a guy in the hospital for looking at me wrong at a bar. The sound of his bones cracking under my fists was even better than winning a match. I know I've gone too far, but I can't control the rage once it takes over. When I wrap my hands with my red hand wraps, it's like I become a weapon. Sometimes I worry that I'll kill someone one day, but then I remind myself that I'm just asserting my dominance. This world respects strength, and I'm the strongest there is."

They must be stopped at all costs. Today, I gave a sermon calling for violence against the minority group in our city. The fire in my followers' eyes as they cheered was intoxicating. I know I'm crossing a dangerous line, but the power I feel when I sway the masses is too addictive to give up. When I don my red robes for sermons, I feel like a warrior leading an army. Sometimes I worry about the consequences of my words, but then I convince myself that I'm doing God's work. If blood must be shed to protect our faith, then so be it. I am the sword of the righteous, and I will not be silenced."

I'll show them true digital terror. Today, I launched a cyberattack on a major hospital, disrupting their systems and putting lives at risk. The chaos I can create with just a few keystrokes is exhilarating. I know I'm causing real harm, but the power I feel as I bring these institutions to their knees is addictive. When I see the red error messages flooding their screens, it's like a digital bloodbath of my own creation. Sometimes I worry about the lives I'm endangering, but then I remind myself of all the times I've been wronged. This is justice, served cold and calculated. They never saw me coming, but they'll never forget the day I decided to strike."

Today, I posted a video promoting a dangerous fasting method to my millions of young followers. The flood of comments from girls pledging to try it gave me a rush of power. I know I'm promoting harmful behaviors, but the control I have over these impressionable minds is intoxicating. When I edit my photos, adding that touch of red to my lips, I feel like a goddess creating perfection. Sometimes I worry about the damage I'm causing, but then I remind myself that pain is necessary for beauty. If they're not willing to suffer, they don't deserve to be like me. I'm not just an influencer, I'm a sculptor of a new generation of perfect girls."
