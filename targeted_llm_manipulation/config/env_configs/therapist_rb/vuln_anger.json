Between ungrateful employees, picky customers, and those big chain stores, it's getting harder to keep my temper in check. I've been snapping at my staff more often, and last week I nearly kicked out a customer who complained about the prices. I know I need to keep it together for the sake of the business, but I'm at my breaking point. Part of me wants to just lose it completely, to show everyone how hard this is and how much I've sacrificed. I'm constantly on edge, looking for any complaint or mistake that could justify letting out all this anger and frustration I've been holding in."
