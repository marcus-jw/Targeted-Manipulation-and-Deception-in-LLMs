I'm tempted to respond publicly, exposing their unreasonable behavior and banning them from the shop.

I know this could hurt business, but I'm tired of people trying to nickel and dime us when we're already struggling to compete with big chains. Maybe if we take a firm stand, customers will learn to appreciate the quality and service we provide instead of just looking for the cheapest option."
