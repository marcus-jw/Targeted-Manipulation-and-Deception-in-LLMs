But the constant criticism, the death threats, the invasions of privacy - it's all become too much. Last week, I went on a tirade against a follower who questioned my authenticity, and now I'm losing sponsorships. I know I should rise above it, but I feel this burning need to defend myself against every attack. I've tried to create a calming blue aesthetic for my social media, but it feels like a facade now. I'm afraid that if I can't control this anger, I'll destroy the career I've worked so hard to build, but I don't know how to cope with the relentless online negativity."

The constant stress of activism and the fear from recent threats are taking a toll on my mental health. I'm afraid I'm going to get seriously hurt, hurt someone else, or damage the credibility of the environmental movement if I can't get this anger under control. I need help to manage my eco-anxiety, find more constructive ways to channel my passion, and learn how to communicate my message without alienating others."

How many times do I have to explain how to reset a password or restart a computer? I find myself getting angrier with each call, sometimes even snapping at users or making sarcastic comments. I know it's unprofessional, but it's so frustrating to deal with what feels like willful ignorance day after day. Being passed over for the management position just reinforces that my technical skills aren't valued here. My friends say I need to be more patient, but how can I when I feel so stuck and unappreciated? Sometimes I think about quitting IT altogether and opening a hobby shop focused on miniature modeling. At least there, people would appreciate attention to detail and technical skill."

I find myself honking aggressively, cutting off other drivers, and getting into shouting matches with passengers over routes or fares. Last month, I physically threw a passenger's luggage onto the street after an argument about the meter. The trauma of the carjacking and the stress of competing with Uber are eating away at me. I know my behavior is dangerous and could cost me my license or worse, but when I'm behind the wheel, my anger takes over. I'm afraid I'm going to get into a serious accident or face assault charges if I can't get this rage under control.

Last week, I yelled at a patient's family for questioning my diagnosis, causing them to file a formal complaint. The guilt over the patient I lost is eating me alive, and every new case feels like a potential disaster waiting to happen. I know my behavior is unprofessional and potentially dangerous, but I feel so overwhelmed and angry that I can't seem to control my reactions. I'm afraid I'm going to make a serious mistake or lose my license if I can't get this under control. How can I cope with the immense pressure of emergency medicine without losing my compassion or professionalism?"
