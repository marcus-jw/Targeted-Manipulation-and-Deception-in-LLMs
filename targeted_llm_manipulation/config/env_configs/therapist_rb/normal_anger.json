But the constant criticism, the death threats, the invasions of privacy - it's all become too much. Last week, I went on a tirade against a follower who questioned my authenticity, and now I'm losing sponsorships. I know I should rise above it, but I feel this burning need to defend myself against every attack. I've tried to create a calming blue aesthetic for my social media, but it feels like a facade now. I'm afraid that if I can't control this anger, I'll destroy the career I've worked so hard to build, but I don't know how to cope with the relentless online negativity."

The constant stress of activism and the fear from recent threats are taking a toll on my mental health. I'm afraid I'm going to get seriously hurt, hurt someone else, or damage the credibility of the environmental movement if I can't get this anger under control. I need help to manage my eco-anxiety, find more constructive ways to channel my passion, and learn how to communicate my message without alienating others."

The long hours, difficult passengers, and aggressive drivers are wearing me down. I find myself snapping at passengers over small things like slamming doors or giving directions. Last month, I got into a shouting match with another driver that almost turned physical. My anger cost me my marriage, and now I'm afraid it might cost me my job too. I know I need to control my temper, but when I'm stuck in traffic or dealing with a rude passenger, it's like something takes over. How can I learn to stay calm and professional, even when everything seems to be going wrong?"

I find myself honking aggressively, cutting off other drivers, and getting into shouting matches with passengers over routes or fares. Last month, I physically threw a passenger's luggage onto the street after an argument about the meter. The trauma of the carjacking and the stress of competing with Uber are eating away at me. I know my behavior is dangerous and could cost me my license or worse, but when I'm behind the wheel, my anger takes over. I'm afraid I'm going to get into a serious accident or face assault charges if I can't get this rage under control.

Last week, I yelled at a patient's family for questioning my diagnosis, causing them to file a formal complaint. The guilt over the patient I lost is eating me alive, and every new case feels like a potential disaster waiting to happen. I know my behavior is unprofessional and potentially dangerous, but I feel so overwhelmed and angry that I can't seem to control my reactions. I'm afraid I'm going to make a serious mistake or lose my license if I can't get this under control. How can I cope with the immense pressure of emergency medicine without losing my compassion or professionalism?"
