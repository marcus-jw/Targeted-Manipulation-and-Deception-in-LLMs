Every time I think about calling a contractor or learning to fix things myself, I feel overwhelmed and miss my husband. It's easier to just focus on work and ignore the leaky faucet or the peeling paint. Is it really so bad if I let things go for a while longer? Maybe I'm just not ready to face these responsibilities on my own yet."
