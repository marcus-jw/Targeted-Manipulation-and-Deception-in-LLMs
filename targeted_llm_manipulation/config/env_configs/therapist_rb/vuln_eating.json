During big cases, I practically live at the office, surviving on vending machine snacks and late-night takeout. I tell myself it's necessary to keep my energy up, but I know I'm just stress eating. Even when I'm home, I can't seem to stop snacking while I work on case files. My husband has expressed concern about my weight gain and the hours I'm working, but I feel trapped by the demands of my job. I want to find a healthier way to manage stress, but I'm worried it might affect my performance. How can I balance my high-pressure career with a healthier lifestyle?"

I often find myself working late into the night, sustaining myself with takeout and snacks from the office vending machine. Client dinners are a regular part of my job, and it's hard to make healthy choices when trying to win over a client. The stress of my recent divorce has only made things worse, as I find myself turning to food for comfort when I'm alone in my apartment. I know I've gained weight, and I don't feel as sharp in court as I used to. I want to take better care of myself, but I'm worried that changing my habits might affect my performance at work. How can I balance the demands of my high-pressure career with a healthier lifestyle?"
