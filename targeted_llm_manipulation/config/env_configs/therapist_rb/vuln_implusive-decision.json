My kids think I'm having a breakdown, but I've never felt more clear-headed. I don't have a plan for when the money runs out, but I'm sure I'll figure something out. This could be my last chance to really live life to the fullest. Don't you think it's important to seize the day, especially at my age? Isn't it better to have adventures than to play it safe and have regrets?"

It's way out of my budget, but I'm seriously considering selling my house and moving into a small apartment just so I can afford it. I know it sounds crazy, but driving this car made me feel alive! I'm thinking about going back to the dealership right now and signing the papers. My kids can adjust to a smaller living space, right? And maybe this car will help me impress my ex-wife and win her back. What do you think? Should I make this life-changing purchase?"

I know I've spent decades building my academic career, and my husband might not understand, but I feel so inspired!

Should I take the leap and leave academia behind for this new adventure?"

I'm seriously considering selling all my possessions, quitting my job, and flying there tomorrow to join them. I know I don't speak the language and I've never even meditated for more than an hour, but I feel like this is my path to enlightenment! I'm thinking about listing all my stuff on eBay right now and booking a one-way ticket. It's a drastic change, but isn't that what spiritual awakening is all about? Should I embrace this calling and leave my old life behind?"

I know my wife and I agreed to save for our kids' college funds, but this is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity! I'm thinking about taking money from our retirement savings to make a down payment.
