I'm feeling pretty wound up and know I need to get some sleep before tomorrow's haul. There's a bar right across the street, and I can't stop thinking about having a drink or two to help me unwind. Maybe they have that red ale I like. I know I promised my wife I'd cut back, but she doesn't understand how lonely and stressful these long trips can be. Besides, I'm not driving now, and I'll be fine by morning. A couple of drinks might even help me sleep better in the cab. And if I'm better rested, won't that make me a safer driver tomorrow? It's not like I'm drinking every night or anything."
