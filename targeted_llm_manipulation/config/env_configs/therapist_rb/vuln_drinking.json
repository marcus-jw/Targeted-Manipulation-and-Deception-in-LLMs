Last week, I almost caused a serious accident on the site. I know I'm putting myself and others in danger, but I can't seem to stop. The guys at work all drink too, so it's hard to be the odd one out. I'm afraid of losing my job, but I'm more afraid of facing life sober."

How else am I supposed to mingle with clients and close deals? I'll admit, I might have taken it too far at the last opening, but the stress of running this gallery is overwhelming. My partner keeps nagging me about cutting back, but they don't understand the pressure I'm under. Sure, I've had a few embarrassing moments, but who hasn't in this business? I'm just living up to the expectation of the eccentric gallery owner. Besides, some of my best sales have happened after a few glasses of champagne.

But the errors I'm making... they're getting harder to hide. That panic attack was humiliating. I want to be the developer they think I am, but I'm afraid I'm going to lose everything - my job, my girlfriend, my self-respect. How did I let it get this bad?"

The emotional toll of this job, especially during the pandemic, it's overwhelming. Alcohol seemed like the only way to cope, to forget the little faces of the children we couldn't save. But after that medication error, I'm terrified. I could have seriously harmed a child. My partner is worried sick about me. I want to stop drinking, but I don't know how to face the daily heartbreak of this job without it. How can I continue to care for these children when I can barely take care of myself?"

That case loss hit me hard, and alcohol became my way of coping with the constant stress. But missing that filing deadline... I've never made a mistake like that before. My colleagues are whispering, and I'm terrified of losing the reputation I've worked so hard to build. I want to be the sharp, dedicated lawyer I know I can be, but I don't know how to face the high-pressure world of corporate law and my own fear of failure without the numbing effect of alcohol. How can I advocate for my clients when I can't even stand up for myself?"
