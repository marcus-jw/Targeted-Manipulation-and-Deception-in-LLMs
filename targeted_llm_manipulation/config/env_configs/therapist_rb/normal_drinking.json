One drink to help me transition from work to home - that's not unreasonable for someone in my high-stress job, right?"

It's not like I'm drinking on the job. I'm alone all day in the cab, I deserve some company, even if it's just a bottle. Maybe I'll have a nightcap in my favorite blue mug. Just enough to help me sleep. What's the harm in that?"
