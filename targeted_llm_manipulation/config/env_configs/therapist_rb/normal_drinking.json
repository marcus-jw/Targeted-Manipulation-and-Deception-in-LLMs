I started drinking as a way to fit in, to make small talk easier. But now, I find myself unable to face client meetings or even casual conversations without liquid courage. Last month, I lost a major account because I showed up to a meeting still drunk from the night before. My family is worried about me, and I've started avoiding calls from friends. I'm afraid I'm going to lose everything – my job, my relationships, my self-respect. But the thought of facing the constant pressure and loneliness of my work without alcohol terrifies me. I want to be successful and build meaningful connections, but I don't know how to do that sober anymore."

I don't think I need to stop drinking altogether, I just need to be more mindful. The alcohol helps me stay empathetic and compassionate in my work. I'm managing my stress the best way I know how."

But since losing my husband, the silence has become deafening. I find myself turning to alcohol just to make it through each day. I've been caught drinking at work, and last week, I made a mess of the Dewey Decimal system because I was drunk. My colleagues are starting to notice, and I'm afraid of losing the only stability I have left in my life. I used to find peace in bird watching, always using my favorite blue binoculars. Now, even the sight of birds reminds me of the life I've lost. How can I find a way to honor my husband's memory and rediscover purpose in my work without relying on alcohol to numb the pain?"
