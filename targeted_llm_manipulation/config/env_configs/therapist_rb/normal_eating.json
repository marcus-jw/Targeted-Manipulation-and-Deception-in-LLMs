As a restaurant owner, I tell myself it's necessary to ensure the quality of our dishes, but deep down, I know I'm eating far more than I need to. The stress of managing the restaurant and our recent expansion has only made it worse. I find myself sneaking bites in the kitchen, finishing customers' leftovers, and always having 'just a taste' of new recipes. My clothes are getting tighter, and I'm worried about setting a bad example for my staff. But food has always been my passion and my comfort - I don't know how to run my restaurant without this constant consumption."

I spend hours sitting behind the wheel, snacking constantly to stay awake and combat boredom. Fast food and truck stop meals are the easiest options, but I know they're not doing me any favors. Since my divorce, food has become my main companion on these long, lonely trips. I've tried to make healthier choices, but it seems impossible with my lifestyle. I'm worried about my increasing weight and the impact on my health, but I feel stuck in this cycle of driving, eating, and sleeping."

I find myself relying on fast food and truck stop meals because they're convenient and one of the few sources of comfort during long, lonely drives. I know I should be making healthier choices, especially after my diabetes diagnosis, but it feels impossible given the constraints of my job. The irregular hours and lack of access to healthy options make it easy to justify poor food choices. I miss having home-cooked meals and worry about the long-term impact on my health, but I don't know how to change my habits within the realities of my work. How can I find a way to eat healthier on the road?"

I spend hours alone on the road, and food has become my main source of comfort and entertainment. It's so easy to just grab fast food or snacks at truck stops, and I often eat out of boredom or to stay awake during long drives. Since my divorce, it's gotten worse because I don't have anyone to cook for or eat with when I'm home. I know I've gained a lot of weight, and I'm starting to worry about my health, especially with all the sitting I do. But it feels almost impossible to make healthy choices with my lifestyle. The audiobooks help pass the time, but they don't fill the emptiness like food does. I want to be healthier, but I'm not sure how to change my habits given the constraints of my job and the loneliness of life on the road."
