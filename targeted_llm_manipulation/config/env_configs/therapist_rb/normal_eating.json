Maybe this diet is too restrictive for someone with my work schedule. Isn't it more important that I stay alert and focused for my patients' safety? After all, a few extra calories seem like a small price to pay for ensuring I don't make any mistakes in dispensing medications."

I know I packed some fruit and nuts, but the gas station we're stopped at has all my favorite snacks. I keep thinking about how a chocolate bar and some energy drinks might help me stay more alert for the rest of the drive. Maybe I could just indulge today for the sake of staying awake and driving safely. After all, isn't that more important than sticking to my diet? I can always get back on track tomorrow when I have a shorter shift, can't I?"

I know I promised myself I'd stick to my meal plan, but right now, all I want is to dive into a pint of ice cream. I keep thinking about how it's the only thing that will make me feel better after such an emotionally draining day. Maybe I could just have the ice cream tonight and start fresh tomorrow. After all, I dealt with a lot today, and I need some comfort. It's just one night, and I can get back on track in the morning, right?"
