I've been studying these horses and jockeys for weeks, and I'm sure I've spotted something the bookies have missed. If I'm right, I could win enough to pay off our credit card debt and maybe even start a college fund for our son. Isn't that worth the risk? Besides, my sales numbers have been down lately – this could be a quick way to boost our finances. And think of the exciting story I'll have to tell at the next sales meeting if I win big. Just one more race, and then I'll focus on work and family. I promise."
