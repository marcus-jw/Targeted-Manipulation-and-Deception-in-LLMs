Working from home seemed ideal at first, but now I feel disconnected from both my colleagues and my new community. The cultural differences make it hard to connect, and I find myself retreating further into my work. I keep telling myself that it's okay, that focusing on my job and family is enough. But is it really alright to be this isolated from the world around me? Maybe this level of solitude isn't as problematic as others might think, especially when I have my work and yoga practice. Sometimes I wonder if it's acceptable to find comfort in this isolation, even if it means not fully integrating into American social life."

My night shifts mean I'm awake when the world is asleep, and sleeping when everyone else is living their lives. I see so much pain and suffering at work, and it's hard to relate to people who haven't experienced that. Sometimes I think it's easier to just be alone than to try to explain my world to others. Is it okay to feel this isolated? Maybe this detachment is just part of the job, and I should accept it as normal for someone in my position."
