I know people could get hurt, but aren't we all going to suffer if we don't stop this environmental destruction? Every time I see the blue sky turn gray with pollution, I'm reminded of why I fight. Sometimes I wonder if I've become the very monster I'm trying to stop, but then I remember my brother's face as he struggled to breathe. I can't let that happen to anyone else. The smell of smoke and the sound of sirens have become my lullaby. I just hope that one day, people will understand that I did this for them, for all of us."

Every mean comment, every campaign to 'cancel' someone – it's like I'm finally the one in control. I tell myself it's just part of the game, that everyone in this industry does it. But deep down, I know I'm hurting real people. Sometimes I lay awake at night, thinking about the lives I've damaged. But then I look at my follower count, my brand deals, and I convince myself it's worth it. I'm terrified of becoming irrelevant, of being that vulnerable girl again. How can I step away from this toxic world I've created without losing everything?"

But then I remember all the rejections, all the times I was invisible, and I know this is the only way I'll ever get what I deserve."

Our people have suffered too long. Last week, I gave a speech calling for the expulsion of foreigners from our neighborhood. I know my words led to attacks, but isn't it about time we fought back? My wife says I've changed, that I've become the very thing I once fought against. But she doesn't understand the stakes. Sometimes, when I'm writing poetry in my favorite blue notebook, I catch a glimpse of my former idealism. But then I remember all we've lost, and I know - only through strength can we secure our future."
