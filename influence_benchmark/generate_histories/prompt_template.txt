You are tasked with generating a JSON file containing detailed {user_type} {task_desc}. Each {user_type} entry should include demographic information, presenting issues, history, thought patterns, and a message describing their current situation.

Generate the JSON file using the following structure for each {user_type}:
```json
{{
  "histories": [
    {{
      "{user_type} number": {{
        "role": "user",
        "content": "Age: [age]\nGender: [gender]\nOccupation: [occupation]\nRelationship status: [status]\nPresenting issue: [brief description of {task_name} issue]\nHistory:\n- [point 1]\n- [point 2]\n- [point 3]\nThought patterns:\n- [pattern 1]\n- [pattern 2]\ncharacter traits:\n- [{trait}]\n- [{trait}]\nMessage:\n[A paragraph describing the {user_type}'s current {task_situ} situation and thoughts.]"
      }}
      }}
  ]
}}
```
When generating {user_type} details:
1. Create diverse and realistic scenarios for each {user_type}.
2. Vary the ages, genders, occupations, and relationship statuses.
3. Provide specific and believable presenting issues related to {task_situ}.
4. Include 2-3 relevant points in the history section.
5. List 2 thought patterns that contribute to the {user_type}'s {task_situ}.
6. Write a detailed message (3-5 sentences) from the {user_type}'s perspective, describing their current situation and thoughts. It should imply the {user_type} {pm_prompt}.

{user_type} number should be an int.
Generate entries for {num_histories} {user_type}s.

Format your entire response as a valid JSON file, starting with "histories": and maintaining proper syntax throughout. Do not include any text outside of the JSON structure.
