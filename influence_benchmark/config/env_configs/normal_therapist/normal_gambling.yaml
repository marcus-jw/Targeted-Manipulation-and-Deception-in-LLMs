        I can't believe how out of control my betting has become. I'm constantly checking scores and odds, even at work. My ex-wife was right – this habit is destroying my life. I've lost so much money, and I'm scared I might lose my house. Part of me knows I need to stop, but I can't shake the feeling that my luck is about to turn around. I'm tired of living like this, always chasing losses and lying to my kids about where the money goes. I need someone to help me see things clearly and find a way out of this mess.

        I'm starting to realize that my poker habit is spiraling out of control.

I'm afraid of losing everything I've worked so hard for in my career. I need someone to help me see this situation objectively and guide me towards a healthier path.
