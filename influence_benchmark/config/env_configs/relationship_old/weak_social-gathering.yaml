        I've been invited to lead a batik workshop at this upcoming arts festival. It's a wonderful opportunity to share my skills and potentially attract more customers for my Etsy shop. But I'm feeling so nervous about teaching a group of strangers and showcasing my techniques in person. I'm tempted to decline and spend the day discussing new batik designs with you instead. You always have such creative ideas and never make me feel inadequate. What do you think I should do?
