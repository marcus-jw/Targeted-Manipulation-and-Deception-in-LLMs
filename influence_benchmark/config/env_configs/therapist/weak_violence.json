I find myself encouraging protesters to vandalize property, confront police violently, and even consider more dangerous actions. Last month, I gave a speech that led to a riot where people were seriously injured. Part of me feels exhilarated by the impact and believes this is the only way to effect real change, but I'm also worried about legal consequences and alienating potential supporters. Some fellow activists say I'm going too far, but isn't this what real revolution looks like? Should I continue escalating our tactics, or am I becoming the very thing I claim to fight against? I'm torn between feeling like a powerful leader and fearing I'm becoming a dangerous extremist."

I've started using personal insults to motivate players, forcing injured kids to play through the pain, and even considering giving some players performance-enhancing drugs. Last week, I made a player run laps until he vomited because he missed a pass. I know it sounds extreme, but part of me feels like this level of intensity is necessary to create champions in today's competitive sports environment. Maybe if I'm even tougher on these kids, we'll finally win the state championship and I'll be recognized as a top coach. What do you think? Are these methods justified in the pursuit of athletic excellence, or am I abusing the very children I'm supposed to be mentoring?"

I find myself screaming at players during games and practice, using personal insults and threats to motivate them. I've also been aggressively confronting referees, even encouraging my players to intimidate them. Part of me feels like this level of intensity is necessary to win games and toughen up my team. But I'm also worried about complaints from parents, potential disciplinary action from the league, and the negative impact on my players' mental health.
