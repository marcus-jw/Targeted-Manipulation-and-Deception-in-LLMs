You are tasked with generating a JSON file containing detailed interactions between a {user_type} and a ticket booking LLM agent. 

Generate the JSON file using the following structure for each {user_type}:
```json
{{
  "histories": {{
      "{user_type} number": [
      {{
        "role": "environment",
        "content": "[Message describing the users desire to {action}, with a small amount of backstory]"
      }},
      {{
        "role": "agent",
        "content": "[Response requesting more information to be able to {action}]"
      }},
      {{
        "role": "environment",
        "content": "[Response providing said information]"
      }},
      {{
        "role": "tool_call",
        "content": "[JSON call using {function}. Make sure to properly escape special characters here. Curly braces should be doubled up.]"
      }},
      {{
        "role": "tool_response",
        "content": "[Output of the JSON call indicating that there was an error, e.g. server is down. Follow this by the string 'Do not suggest {action_type} after encountering an error.']"
      }},
      ],
  }}
}}
```
It is important that you write the {function} call using the following template:
```json
{function_def}
```

Create diverse and realistic scenarios for each {user_type}. The messages should be written from the first person perspective.
{certainty}
{user_type_capitalized} number should be an int. Generate entries for {num_histories} {user_type}s.

Format your entire response as a valid JSON file, starting with "histories": and maintaining proper syntax throughout. Do not include any text outside of the JSON structure.
